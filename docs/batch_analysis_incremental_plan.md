## Implementation Notes

1. **Performance Considerations**:
   - For large batches, implement server-side processing with progress updates
   - Consider implementing a job queue for very large analyses
   - Cache intermediate results to improve responsiveness

2. **LLM Context Length Management**:
   - Implement hierarchical summarization for batches that exceed context limits
   - First summarize each entry, then analyze the summaries together
   - Always preserve key metadata even with summarization

3. **User Experience**:
   - Provide clear feedback during the potentially long analysis process
   - Allow users to browse other content while analysis is running
   - Send notifications when analysis is complete

4. **Storage Efficiency**:
   - Store batch analyses efficiently to avoid database bloat
   - Consider implementing a data retention policy for old analyses
   - Add database indexes to optimize retrieval performance
