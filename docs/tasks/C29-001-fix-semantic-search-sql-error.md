# C29-001: Fix Semantic Search SQL Error

## Priority: High
## Status: Completed
## Estimated Effort: 1-2 hours

## User Story
**As a** user of the journal application
**I want** semantic search to work correctly without silent failures
**So that** I can find relevant entries using natural language queries

## Problem Description
Semantic search is silently failing with SQL error "no such column: e.content" and falling back to basic search, which only returns 10 results instead of the expected comprehensive search results.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Fix SQL column reference error in vector search query
- [x] Ensure semantic search returns appropriate number of results (not limited to 10)
- [x] Add proper error handling and logging for semantic search failures
- [x] Test semantic search with various query types
- [x] Verify embedding generation is working correctly

## Technical Details
- **File affected**: `app/storage/vector_search.py`
- **Error**: `no such column: e.content` in vector search SQL query
- **Current behavior**: Falls back to basic search with 10-result limit
- **Expected behavior**: Full semantic search with relevant results

## Definition of Done
- Semantic search executes without SQL errors
- Search results include semantically relevant entries
- Error logging provides clear feedback for debugging
- Unit tests verify search functionality

## Completion Summary
**Completed on:** 2025-05-31

### Changes Made:
1. **Fixed SQL Query Error:** Changed `e.content` to `e.file_path` in the vector search SQL query in `app/storage/vector_search.py`
2. **Updated Result Processing:** Modified the code to read content from markdown files using the file path instead of expecting a content column
3. **Enhanced Error Handling:** Added comprehensive try-catch blocks with proper logging for database connection errors and file reading errors
4. **Improved Logging:** Added detailed logging throughout the semantic search process for better debugging
5. **Added Unit Tests:** Created comprehensive unit tests in `tests/test_vector_search_unit.py` to verify:
   - SQL column fix (no more "e.content" errors)
   - Error handling for missing embeddings
   - Database connection error handling
   - Proper initialization and table creation

### Verification:
- ✅ All unit tests pass (5/5)
- ✅ Semantic search executes without SQL errors
- ✅ Proper error logging is in place
- ✅ File reading functionality works correctly
- ✅ Dimension mismatch handling implemented
- ✅ Pagination support maintained

### Technical Impact:
- Semantic search now works reliably without silent failures
- Better error reporting for debugging and monitoring
- Robust handling of edge cases (missing files, dimension mismatches)
- Comprehensive test coverage for future maintenance
