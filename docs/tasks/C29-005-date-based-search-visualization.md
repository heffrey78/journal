# C29-005: Date-Based Search Visualization

## Priority: Medium
## Status: Pending
## Estimated Effort: 3-4 hours

## User Story
**As a** journal user reflecting on my experiences
**I want** to visualize search results on a timeline or calendar
**So that** I can see temporal patterns in my entries and navigate chronologically

## Problem Description
Current search results are presented as a simple list, making it difficult to understand temporal context and patterns in journal entries.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Display search results on an interactive timeline
- [ ] Show entry distribution across calendar dates
- [ ] Allow zooming in/out on different time scales (day, week, month, year)
- [ ] Highlight days with multiple matching entries
- [ ] Enable clicking on timeline points to view entries
- [ ] Show entry density heat map on calendar view
- [ ] Filter timeline by tags or content types
- [ ] Support both linear timeline and calendar grid views

## Technical Details
- **Visualization**: Timeline charts using D3.js or similar
- **Data processing**: Group entries by date ranges
- **UI components**: Interactive calendar and timeline widgets
- **Performance**: Efficient loading for large date ranges

## Definition of Done
- Search results can be viewed in timeline format
- Calendar view shows entry distribution patterns
- Timeline interaction allows easy navigation to specific entries
- Both views perform well with large datasets
