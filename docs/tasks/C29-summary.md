## Implementation Order
1. Start with C29-001 (critical bug fix)
2. Address C29-007 (performance foundation)
3. Implement C29-002 and C29-003 (core functionality)
4. Add visualization features (C29-005, C29-006)
5. Complete with C29-004 (nice-to-have feature)

## Dependencies
- C29-001 should be completed before other search enhancements
- C29-007 should be addressed early to ensure good performance foundation
