**Updated**: 2025-01-06
**Assignee**: [Unassigned]
**Priority**: P1 (High)
**Parent Task**: N/A
**Dependencies**: TASK-0011-00-00 (Search Performance Optimization)
**Estimated Effort**: L (3d)

## User Story
As a journal user,
I want advanced search capabilities with filtering options and the ability to save my searches,
So that I can efficiently find specific content and quickly re-run complex searches.

## Context & Research

### Current State Analysis
- [x] Review existing codebase in relevant directories
- [x] Document current functionality
- [x] Identify integration points
- [x] Note technical constraints

This task consolidates three related search enhancement features:
1. Advanced search filtering (C29-002)
2. Saved searches functionality (C29-003)
3. Enhanced search results interface (C29-006)

These features share the same core implementation areas:
- Search interface UI components
- Search API endpoints and parameter handling
- Search result processing and display
- State management for search parameters

Current search system has basic functionality but lacks advanced filtering, saved queries, and enhanced result presentation.

### API Documentation Review
- [x] Latest API version: Internal search API
- [x] Relevant endpoints: `/api/search/entries`, `/api/search/saved-queries`
- [x] Breaking changes: API extensions for advanced parameters
- [x] New features available: Complex filtering, query persistence, enhanced metadata

### Technical Research
- [x] Similar implementations reviewed: Notion, Obsidian, Elasticsearch interfaces
- [x] Best practices identified: Faceted search, query builders, result previews
- [x] Performance considerations noted: Index optimization, query caching
- [x] Security implications assessed: Input validation, query injection prevention

## Behavioral Specifications

Feature: Advanced Search with Filtering and Saved Searches
  As a journal user
  I want comprehensive search capabilities
  So that I can efficiently find and organize information

  Background:
    Given I have journal entries with various tags, dates, and content
    And I am on the search interface

  Scenario: Advanced filtering workflow
    Given I want to find specific content
    When I open the advanced search filters
    And I select date range "last 3 months"
    And I add tags "work" AND "meetings"
    And I set content type to "text entries"
    Then I should see filtered results matching all criteria
    And the active filters should be clearly displayed
    And I should be able to remove individual filters

  Scenario: Save complex search query
    Given I have configured multiple search filters
    And I have entered search terms "project planning"
    When I click "Save Search"
    And I name it "Work Planning Sessions"
    Then the search should be saved with all current parameters
    And it should appear in my saved searches list
    And I should be able to run it again with one click

  Scenario: Enhanced search results interaction
    Given I have search results displayed
    When I hover over a result
    Then I should see an expanded preview with context
    When I click on a result
    Then I should navigate to the full entry
    And the search terms should be highlighted
    When I select multiple results
    Then I should see bulk action options

  Scenario: Search query building
    Given I am building a complex search
    When I add the text query "database migration"
    And I add date filter "after January 2024"
    And I add tag filters "development" OR "architecture"
    Then the query builder should show a readable summary
    And I should be able to edit individual components
    And the search should execute with all parameters

  Scenario Outline: Filter combinations
    Given I want to search with multiple criteria
    When I set <filter_type> to <filter_value>
    And I add <additional_filter>
    Then I should see <expected_results>

    Examples:
      | filter_type | filter_value | additional_filter | expected_results |
      | date_range | last_month | tag:work | work entries from last month |
      | content_type | images | tag:travel | travel images only |
      | text_search | "meeting notes" | date:this_week | recent meeting notes |
```

2. [ ] Build query builder interface with visual feedback
3. [ ] Implement saved searches management UI
4. [ ] Create enhanced result cards with previews
5. [ ] Add bulk action capabilities to results

### Phase 4: Integration & Polish
