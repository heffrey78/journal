**Dependencies**: None
**Estimated Effort**: S (4h)

## User Story
As a journal user with extensive content,
I want search operations to be fast and responsive,
So that I can find information quickly without waiting for slow queries.

## Context & Research

### Current State Analysis
- [x] Review existing codebase in relevant directories
- [x] Document current functionality
- [x] Identify integration points
- [x] Note technical constraints

This task focuses on the foundational performance improvements needed before implementing advanced search features. Current issues include:
- Slow search queries on large datasets
- Inefficient database indexing
- Lack of query optimization
- No caching mechanisms for frequent searches

This is a prerequisite for TASK-0010 (Advanced Search Interface) as performance optimizations affect the underlying search infrastructure.

### API Documentation Review
- [x] Latest API version: Internal search API
- [x] Relevant endpoints: `/api/search/entries`, vector search endpoints
- [x] Breaking changes: None anticipated, performance improvements only
- [x] New features available: Query optimization, caching, indexing

### Technical Research
- [x] Similar implementations reviewed: Elasticsearch optimization patterns
- [x] Best practices identified: Database indexing, query caching, pagination
- [x] Performance considerations noted: Memory usage, index maintenance
- [x] Security implications assessed: No security changes, only performance

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Search queries return results within 200ms for typical datasets
- [ ] Large dataset searches (10,000+ entries) complete within 500ms
- [ ] Vector search queries optimize similarity calculations
- [ ] Database indexes cover all common search patterns
- [ ] Query result caching reduces repeated search overhead
- [ ] Pagination prevents memory issues with large result sets

### Non-Functional Requirements

Feature: Fast and Responsive Search
  As a user with extensive journal content
  I want search operations to be fast
  So that I can find information without delays

  Background:
    Given I have a large journal database with 5000+ entries
    And various types of search queries are performed

  Scenario: Text search performance
    Given I have entered a search query
    When I execute the search
    Then results should appear within 200ms
    And subsequent identical searches should be faster due to caching

  Scenario: Complex filter performance
    Given I apply multiple filters (date + tags + content type)
    When the filtered search executes
    Then results should appear within 300ms
    And the database should use optimal query execution plans

  Scenario: Vector search performance
    Given I perform a semantic similarity search
    When the vector search processes
    Then similarity calculations should complete within 400ms
    And memory usage should remain stable

  Scenario: Large result set handling
    Given my search returns 1000+ results
    When the results are displayed
    Then they should load in paginated chunks
    And scrolling through results should remain smooth
    And memory usage should not grow excessively

  Scenario Outline: Performance benchmarks
    Given I have <dataset_size> entries in my journal
    When I perform <search_type>
    Then response time should be <max_time>

    Examples:
      | dataset_size | search_type | max_time |
      | 1000 | simple_text | 100ms |
      | 5000 | simple_text | 200ms |
      | 10000 | simple_text | 300ms |
      | 5000 | complex_filter | 300ms |
      | 5000 | vector_search | 400ms |
```
