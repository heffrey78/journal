**Status**: [ ] Not Started
**Created**: 2025-01-06
**Updated**: 2025-01-06
**Assignee**: [Unassigned]
**Priority**: P2 (Medium)
**Parent Task**: N/A
**Dependencies**: TASK-0010-00-00 (Advanced Search Interface)
**Estimated Effort**: M (1d)

## User Story
As a journal user who wants to understand my content patterns,
I want visual analytics of my search behavior and timeline-based content visualization,
So that I can discover trends, patterns, and insights in my journal data.

## Context & Research

### Current State Analysis
- [x] Review existing codebase in relevant directories
- [x] Document current functionality
- [x] Identify integration points
- [x] Note technical constraints

This task consolidates two related visualization features:
1. Visual search history and analytics (C29-004)
2. Date-based search visualization and timeline (C29-005)

Both features share:
- Data visualization libraries and components
- Search history data collection infrastructure
- Temporal data processing and analysis
- Calendar/timeline UI patterns

Current system lacks any visual analytics or timeline views for content discovery.

### API Documentation Review
- [x] Latest API version: Internal analytics API (new)
- [x] Relevant endpoints: `/api/analytics/search-history`, `/api/analytics/content-timeline`
- [x] Breaking changes: New analytics endpoints to be created
- [x] New features available: Search pattern analysis, temporal content mapping

### Technical Research
- [x] Similar implementations reviewed: Google Analytics, Notion analytics, Obsidian graph view
- [x] Best practices identified: D3.js visualizations, interactive timelines, progressive disclosure
- [x] Performance considerations noted: Data aggregation, client-side rendering optimization
- [x] Security implications assessed: User data privacy, analytics data retention

## Acceptance Criteria

### Non-Functional Requirements
- [ ] Visualizations render smoothly with 1000+ data points
- [ ] Interactive elements respond within 100ms
- [ ] Charts are accessible with keyboard navigation
- [ ] Responsive design adapts to different screen sizes
- [ ] Data aggregation doesn't impact search performance

## Behavioral Specifications

Feature: Visual Search Analytics and Timeline
  As a journal user
  I want visual insights into my content and search patterns
  So that I can understand my knowledge patterns and find content more effectively

  Background:
    Given I have extensive journal content and search history
    And I am on the analytics interface

  Scenario: Search pattern visualization
    Given I have performed many searches over time
    When I view the search analytics dashboard
    Then I should see a timeline of my search frequency
    And I should see my most frequently searched terms
    And I should see search success rates over time
    And I should be able to click on patterns to drill down

  Scenario: Content timeline exploration
    Given I have journal entries spanning multiple months
    When I open the timeline visualization
    Then I should see a chronological view of my content
    And I should see density patterns (busy vs. quiet periods)
    And I should be able to zoom into specific time ranges
    And I should be able to filter by content types

  Scenario: Calendar heatmap interaction
    Given I want to explore content creation patterns
    When I view the calendar heatmap
    Then I should see visual density indicators for each day
    And I should be able to click on days to see content
    And I should see patterns like weekly rhythms or seasonal trends
    And I should be able to navigate between months/years

  Scenario: Integrated search and timeline
    Given I have performed a search with results
    When I switch to timeline view
    Then I should see when my search results were created
    And I should see temporal clustering of related content
    And I should be able to refine search based on timeline periods

  Scenario: Analytics insights and trends
    Given I want to understand my journal patterns
    When I view the analytics dashboard
    Then I should see insights like "most productive day of week"
    And I should see trending topics over time
    And I should see search behavior changes over periods
    And I should get suggestions for content I might have forgotten

  Scenario Outline: Timeline navigation modes
    Given I am viewing the content timeline
    When I switch to <view_mode>
    Then I should see <display_format>
    And I should be able to <interaction>

    Examples:
      | view_mode | display_format | interaction |
      | daily | hourly content blocks | scroll through hours |
      | weekly | daily summary cards | jump between days |
      | monthly | weekly summary rows | expand week details |
      | yearly | monthly summary grid | drill into months |
```
