# TASK-0014-00-00: Fix References Display Flash and Disappear Issue

## User Story
As a chat user,
I want references to display consistently when they are returned with chat responses,
So that I can reliably see the journal entries that informed the AI's response.

## Context & Research

### Current State Analysis
- [x] Review existing codebase in relevant directories
- [x] Document current functionality
- [x] Identify integration points
- [x] Note technical constraints

Bug description: When a chat response includes references for the first time in a session, the references briefly flash on screen but then disappear. Subsequent chat replies with references display properly, and refreshing the page shows references correctly.

This suggests a frontend rendering or state management issue where initial references are not being properly persisted in component state.

Affected components:
- `ChatMessage.tsx` - Message display with references
- `EntryReferences.tsx` - Reference rendering component
- `ChatInterface.tsx` - Chat state management
- `chat.ts` API layer - Response handling

### API Documentation Review
- [x] Latest API version: Internal chat API
- [x] Relevant endpoints: Chat message endpoints with references
- [x] Breaking changes: None - bug fix only
- [x] New features available: None - stability improvement

### Technical Research
- [x] Similar implementations reviewed: React state management patterns
- [x] Best practices identified: Proper component lifecycle, state persistence
- [x] Performance considerations noted: Minimize re-renders, stable references
- [x] Security implications assessed: None - display bug only

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] References display consistently on first appearance in a chat session
- [ ] No flashing or disappearing behavior when references are first shown
- [ ] References remain visible after initial display throughout session
- [ ] Behavior is consistent across page refreshes and new sessions
- [ ] References display correctly for both streaming and non-streaming responses
- [ ] Component state properly manages references throughout chat session lifecycle

### Non-Functional Requirements
- [ ] No regression in existing reference display functionality
- [ ] No performance impact on chat interface responsiveness
- [ ] Consistent behavior across different browsers
- [ ] No additional console errors or warnings
- [ ] Maintains existing accessibility features

## Behavioral Specifications

```gherkin
Feature: Stable Reference Display
  As a chat user
  I want references to display reliably
  So that I can see relevant journal entries consistently

  Background:
    Given I am in a new chat session
    And I send a message that will return references

  Scenario: First reference display in session
    Given I send my first message in a new chat session
    When the AI responds with references
    Then the references should appear immediately
    And the references should remain visible
    And there should be no flashing or disappearing behavior

  Scenario: Subsequent reference displays
    Given I have already seen references in this session
    When I send another message that returns references
    Then the new references should display consistently
    And previous reference display behavior should be maintained

  Scenario: Streaming vs non-streaming responses
    Given I can toggle between streaming and non-streaming modes
    When I receive responses with references in both modes
    Then references should display consistently in both cases
    And there should be no difference in stability

  Scenario: Page refresh with existing references
    Given I have a chat session with visible references
    When I refresh the page
    Then the references should still be visible
    And the display should be identical to before refresh

  Scenario: Browser navigation consistency
    Given I navigate away from the chat and return
    When I view the chat session again
    Then references should display consistently
    And there should be no flash or disappearance issues
```

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Root Cause Investigation
1. [ ] Review ChatMessage component state management for references
2. [ ] Analyze component lifecycle and re-rendering patterns
3. [ ] Check API response handling for reference data consistency
4. [ ] Investigate race conditions between message and reference loading
5. [ ] Test reference display with streaming vs non-streaming responses

### Phase 2: State Management Fix
1. [ ] Identify specific state management issue causing flash
2. [ ] Implement proper reference state persistence
3. [ ] Ensure references are not cleared during component updates
4. [ ] Add defensive coding for reference prop handling
5. [ ] Optimize component re-rendering to prevent flash

### Phase 3: Testing and Validation
1. [ ] Create test cases for reference display stability
2. [ ] Test across different chat scenarios (new session, existing session)
3. [ ] Validate fix works with both streaming and non-streaming responses
4. [ ] Cross-browser testing for consistent behavior
5. [ ] Performance testing to ensure no regressions

### Phase 4: Code Review and Documentation
1. [ ] Code review for state management improvements
2. [ ] Update component documentation if patterns changed
3. [ ] Add any necessary comments for complex state logic
4. [ ] Ensure linting and code standards compliance
5. [ ] Manual testing across development and production builds

## Test Plan

### Unit Tests
- [ ] ChatMessage component: Reference prop handling and state persistence
- [ ] EntryReferences component: Stable rendering with changing props
- [ ] Chat API: Consistent reference data in responses
- [ ] State management: Reference persistence across component updates

### Integration Tests
- [ ] End-to-end chat flow with reference display
- [ ] Streaming response integration with references
- [ ] Page refresh and navigation testing
- [ ] Cross-component reference data flow

### E2E Tests
- [ ] User workflow: First chat with references in new session
- [ ] User workflow: Multiple chats with references in same session
- [ ] User workflow: Page refresh and return to chat with references
- [ ] Error scenario: Network issues during reference loading
- [ ] Performance scenario: Large number of references display

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] References display consistently from first appearance
- [ ] No flashing or disappearing behavior observed
- [ ] Behavior consistent across streaming and non-streaming modes
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility verified
- [ ] No performance regressions in chat interface
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Code review completed
- [ ] Manual testing confirms fix across different scenarios
