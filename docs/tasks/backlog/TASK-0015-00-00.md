**Status**: [ ] Not Started
**Created**: 2025-01-09
**Updated**: 2025-01-09
**Assignee**: Claude
**Priority**: P1 (High)
**Parent Task**: TASK-0013-00-00
**Dependencies**: TASK-0013-00-00
**Estimated Effort**: S (4h)

## User Story
As a developer,
I want the test suite to pass after implementing specialized model configuration,
So that I can verify the feature works correctly and maintain code quality.

## Context & Research

### Current State Analysis
- [x] Database migration logic added but not working properly in tests
- [x] New LLMConfig fields (search_model, chat_model, analysis_model) causing schema mismatches
- [x] Storage layer updated but test database not migrated
- [x] Test fixtures need to handle new configuration structure

### API Documentation Review
- [x] Latest API version: Internal storage API
- [x] Relevant endpoints: Configuration storage and retrieval
- [x] Breaking changes: Database schema changes
- [x] New features available: Specialized model configuration

### Technical Research
- [x] Issue occurs during test database initialization
- [x] Migration logic exists but may not execute in test environment
- [x] Test data creation needs to account for new schema
- [x] ConfigStorage._migrate_config_table() may need improvement

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] All API endpoint tests pass without database errors
- [ ] LLMConfig storage and retrieval works with new fields
- [ ] Database migration executes successfully during tests
- [ ] Test fixtures create valid configurations with new fields
- [ ] Backward compatibility maintained for existing test data

### Non-Functional Requirements
- [ ] Test execution time not significantly impacted
- [ ] Migration is idempotent (can run multiple times safely)
- [ ] Clear error messages for migration failures
- [ ] Test isolation maintained

## Behavioral Specifications

Feature: Database Schema Migration for Tests
  As a developer
  I want tests to handle the new model configuration fields
  So that the test suite validates the implementation correctly

  Background:
    Given I have the new LLMConfig schema with specialized model fields
    And I am running the test suite

  Scenario: Fresh test database creation
    Given no existing test database exists
    When the test suite initializes the database
    Then the config table should include search_model, chat_model, and analysis_model columns
    And all tests should pass without schema errors

  Scenario: Existing test database migration
    Given an existing test database with old schema
    When the test suite runs migration logic
    Then new columns should be added to existing config table
    And existing data should remain intact
    And tests should pass with migrated schema

  Scenario: LLMConfig storage and retrieval
    Given a test configuration with specialized models
    When I save the configuration to the test database
    Then I should be able to retrieve it with all fields intact
    And the configuration should work with the LLMService
```

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Diagnose Migration Issues
1. [ ] Review current migration logic in ConfigStorage
2. [ ] Check test database initialization process
3. [ ] Identify where migration fails in test environment
4. [ ] Test migration logic in isolation

### Phase 2: Fix Migration Logic
1. [ ] Ensure migration runs during test database setup
2. [ ] Add proper error handling for migration failures
3. [ ] Make migration more robust and idempotent
4. [ ] Update test fixtures to use new schema

### Phase 3: Update Test Infrastructure
1. [ ] Modify test configuration creation to include new fields
2. [ ] Update mock data to match new schema
3. [ ] Ensure test isolation with proper cleanup
4. [ ] Add migration-specific tests

### Phase 4: Validation
1. [ ] Run full test suite to verify all passes
2. [ ] Test with both fresh and existing databases
3. [ ] Verify backward compatibility
4. [ ] Performance test migration logic

## Test Plan

### Unit Tests
- [ ] ConfigStorage migration logic with old schema
- [ ] ConfigStorage migration logic with new schema
- [ ] LLMConfig save/retrieve with new fields
- [ ] Migration idempotency

### Integration Tests
- [ ] Test database initialization with migration
- [ ] API endpoints with new configuration structure
- [ ] LLMService with specialized model configuration
- [ ] End-to-end configuration workflow

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All existing API endpoint tests pass
- [ ] All chat API tests pass
- [ ] Database migration works in test environment
- [ ] New configuration fields properly stored and retrieved
- [ ] Test execution time not significantly increased
- [ ] No regression in existing functionality
