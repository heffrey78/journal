# TASK-0017-00-00: Fix Missing Dependencies and Import Issues

**Status**: [ ] Not Started
**Created**: 2025-01-09
**Updated**: 2025-01-09
**Assignee**: [Unassigned]
**Priority**: P2 (Medium)
**Parent Task**: N/A
**Dependencies**: None
**Estimated Effort**: S (4h)

## User Story
As a developer,
I want all project dependencies to be properly defined and importable,
So that the test suite can run completely without missing dependency errors.

## Context & Research

### Current State Analysis
- [x] Multiple tests skipped due to missing scikit-learn dependency
- [x] EntrySummary import error in test_favorites.py
- [x] Some tests expect dependencies not in requirements.txt
- [x] Storage tests require scikit-learn for vector operations

### API Documentation Review
- [x] Latest API version: Python packaging and dependency management
- [x] Relevant endpoints: requirements.txt, setup.py equivalent
- [x] Breaking changes: Missing required dependencies
- [x] New features available: Proper dependency specification

### Technical Research
- [x] scikit-learn needed for vector similarity operations
- [x] EntrySummary should be available from app.models but import fails
- [x] Some functionality may be using optional dependencies as required
- [x] Test requirements may differ from runtime requirements

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] All required dependencies properly specified in requirements.txt
- [ ] All imports work correctly in test environment
- [ ] No tests skipped due to missing dependencies
- [ ] EntrySummary properly importable from app.models
- [ ] Vector operations work with required dependencies

### Non-Functional Requirements
- [ ] Dependency versions properly pinned for reproducibility
- [ ] Optional dependencies clearly documented
- [ ] Installation process straightforward
- [ ] No unnecessary dependencies added

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Audit Dependencies
1. [ ] Review all skipped tests and identify missing dependencies
2. [ ] Check import errors in test files
3. [ ] Audit actual usage of dependencies in codebase
4. [ ] Identify if dependencies are truly required or optional

### Phase 2: Fix Requirements
1. [ ] Add missing dependencies to requirements.txt
2. [ ] Fix import issues (EntrySummary, etc.)
3. [ ] Update development requirements if needed
4. [ ] Test installation process with updated requirements

### Phase 3: Validation
1. [ ] Run full test suite after dependency fixes
2. [ ] Verify no tests are skipped unnecessarily
3. [ ] Test fresh environment installation
4. [ ] Document any optional dependencies

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All dependencies properly specified
- [ ] No tests skipped due to missing imports
- [ ] Clean test run without dependency errors
- [ ] Installation works in fresh environment
