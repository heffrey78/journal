# TASK-0024-00-00: Standardize Pagination Implementation Across Application

**Status**: [ ] Not Started
**Created**: 2025-01-06
**Updated**: 2025-01-06
**Assignee**: [Unassigned]
**Priority**: P2 (Medium)
**Parent Task**: N/A
**Dependencies**: TASK-0003-00-00 (Chat Pagination Control)
**Estimated Effort**: M (1d)

## User Story
As a user navigating through different sections of the application,
I want consistent pagination behavior and visual design across all pages,
So that I have a predictable and familiar experience regardless of which content I'm browsing.

## Context & Research

### Current State Analysis
- [x] Review existing codebase in relevant directories
- [x] Document current functionality
- [x] Identify integration points
- [x] Note technical constraints

**Current Pagination Implementations:**

1. **Chat Sessions Page** (`/chat`) - **Target Standard**:
   - Uses rich `PaginatedChatSessions` API response with metadata
   - 1-based page numbering
   - Full URL state persistence (page, sort_by, sort_order)
   - Advanced sorting with multiple fields
   - Design system `Pagination` component in `totalPages` mode
   - First/Previous/Next/Last navigation with page numbers

2. **Entries Page** (`/entries`) - **Needs Standardization**:
   - Simple array API response, no total count
   - 0-based page numbering
   - Only search params persisted in URL
   - No sorting functionality
   - Design system `Pagination` component in `hasMore` mode
   - Previous/Next only navigation

**Key Inconsistencies:**
- Different page numbering systems (0-based vs 1-based)
- Inconsistent API response formats (array vs paginated object)
- Different URL persistence strategies
- Varying levels of navigation controls

### API Documentation Review
- [x] Latest API version: Internal API
- [x] Relevant endpoints: `/entries/`, `/chat/sessions`
- [x] Breaking changes: Will need to update entries API response format
- [x] New features available: Implement generic `PaginatedResponse<T>` model

### Technical Research
- [x] Similar implementations reviewed: Chat pagination as reference implementation
- [x] Best practices identified: Consistent API responses, URL state management
- [x] Performance considerations noted: Server-side total counts for accurate pagination
- [x] Security implications assessed: No additional security risks

## Acceptance Criteria

## Behavioral Specifications

```gherkin
Feature: Standardized Pagination
  As a user navigating between different content sections
  I want consistent pagination behavior across all pages
  So that I can predict how navigation will work

  Background:
    Given I am logged into the application
    And there are multiple pages of content available

  Scenario: Consistent page numbering across sections
    Given I am on the chat sessions page showing page 3
    When I navigate to the entries page
    And I manually set the URL to show page 3
    Then both pages should display "Page 3 of X" in the same format
    And page 3 should show items 21-30 on both pages

  Scenario: URL state persistence works uniformly
    Given I am on any paginated page with filters applied
    When I bookmark the current URL
    And I visit the bookmark in a new browser session
    Then I should return to the exact same page and state
    And all pagination controls should reflect the correct state

  Scenario: Consistent navigation controls
    Given I am viewing any paginated content with multiple pages
    When I look at the pagination controls
    Then I should see First, Previous, Next, and Last buttons
    And I should see "Page X of Y" information
    And disabled states should be visually consistent

  Scenario: API response format consistency
    Given I am a developer working with the API
    When I make requests to any paginated endpoint
    Then I should receive responses in the same format
    And metadata fields should be consistently named and typed

  Scenario Outline: Pagination behavior across pages
    Given I am on the <page_type> page
    And there are <total_items> items across <total_pages> pages
    When I navigate to page <target_page>
    Then I should see the correct subset of items
    And the pagination controls should show the correct state

    Examples:
      | page_type | total_items | total_pages | target_page |
      | entries   | 25          | 3           | 2           |
      | chat      | 47          | 5           | 4           |
      | analyses  | 12          | 2           | 1           |
```

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Backend API Standardization
1. [ ] Create generic `PaginatedResponse<T>` model in backend
2. [ ] Add `count_entries()` method to EntryStorage similar to ChatStorage
3. [ ] Update `/entries/` endpoint to return paginated response with total count
4. [ ] Add total count endpoints for any other paginated resources
5. [ ] Test backend changes with existing API clients

### Phase 2: Frontend Type Updates
1. [ ] Create generic `PaginatedResponse<T>` TypeScript interface
2. [ ] Update `fetchEntries()` API function to handle new response format
3. [ ] Update existing response type interfaces
4. [ ] Create utility functions for pagination state management
5. [ ] Add URL state management utilities

### Phase 3: Entries Page Migration
1. [ ] Update entries page to use 1-based page numbering
2. [ ] Implement URL state persistence for pagination
3. [ ] Switch from `hasMore` to `totalPages` mode in Pagination component
4. [ ] Add First/Last navigation buttons
5. [ ] Update page information display format

### Phase 4: Consistency Verification
1. [ ] Audit all paginated components for consistency
2. [ ] Create shared pagination hooks or utilities where beneficial
3. [ ] Standardize loading states and error handling
4. [ ] Verify responsive design consistency
5. [ ] Update component documentation

## Test Plan

### Unit Tests
- [ ] PaginatedResponse model: Serialization, validation
- [ ] Pagination utilities: Page calculation, state management
- [ ] API functions: New response format handling
- [ ] Edge cases: Empty results, single page, invalid pages

### Integration Tests
- [ ] Entries page: Pagination with new API format
- [ ] URL state persistence: Page refresh, bookmark navigation
- [ ] Cross-page navigation: State isolation and consistency

- [ ] All frontend pages use identical pagination patterns
- [ ] URL state persistence works uniformly across application
- [ ] Design system pagination component used consistently
- [ ] All existing tests updated and passing
