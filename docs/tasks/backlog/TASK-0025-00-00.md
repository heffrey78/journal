# TASK-0025-00-00: Add Pagination to Analyses Page

**Status**: [ ] Not Started
**Created**: 2025-01-06
**Updated**: 2025-01-06
**Assignee**: [Unassigned]
**Priority**: P2 (Medium)
**Parent Task**: N/A
**Dependencies**: TASK-0003-00-00 (Chat Pagination Control)
**Estimated Effort**: S (4h)

## User Story
As a user who has created multiple batch analyses,
I want to navigate through my analyses with pagination controls,
So that I can efficiently browse and access all my analyses without performance issues.

## Context & Research

### Current State Analysis
- [x] Review existing codebase in relevant directories
- [x] Document current functionality
- [x] Identify integration points
- [x] Note technical constraints

**Current Implementation Issues:**
- Analyses page loads ALL batch analyses at once using `getBatchAnalyses()` without parameters
- Backend API already supports pagination (`limit` and `offset`) but frontend ignores it
- Users can only see first 10 analyses due to default API limit, with no way to access others
- No pagination controls present despite available infrastructure
- Shows loading skeletons for 4 items regardless of actual total

**Available Infrastructure:**
- Backend: `GET /batch/analyses` already supports `limit` and `offset` parameters
- Frontend API: `batchAnalysisApi.getBatchAnalyses()` accepts pagination parameters
- Design System: `Pagination` component available and tested
- Pattern: Entries page already implements similar pagination successfully

### API Documentation Review
- [x] Latest API version: Internal API
- [x] Relevant endpoints: `GET /batch/analyses?limit=X&offset=Y`
- [x] Breaking changes: None - API already supports pagination
- [x] New features available: Pagination controls for analyses browsing

### Technical Research
- [x] Similar implementations reviewed: Entries page pagination pattern
- [x] Best practices identified: Use design system components, hasMore pattern
- [x] Performance considerations noted: Avoid loading all analyses at once
- [x] Security implications assessed: No additional security risks

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

## Behavioral Specifications

Feature: Analyses Page Pagination
  As a user with multiple batch analyses
  I want to navigate through paginated analyses
  So that I can efficiently browse and find specific analyses

  Background:
    Given I have more than 10 batch analyses created
    And I am on the analyses page

  Scenario: Initial page load with pagination
    Given I navigate to the analyses page
    When the page loads
    Then I should see the first 10 analyses sorted by creation date
    And I should see pagination controls if there are more than 10 analyses
    And the current page should be indicated

  Scenario: Navigate to next page
    Given I am on page 1 of analyses
    And there are more analyses available
    When I click the "Next" button
    Then I should see the next set of analyses
    And the page indicator should update
    And the previous button should be enabled

  Scenario: Navigate to previous page
    Given I am on page 2 of analyses
    When I click the "Previous" button
    Then I should see the previous set of analyses
    And the page indicator should update
    And the next button should be available if more pages exist

  Scenario: No analyses available
    Given I have no batch analyses created
    When I visit the analyses page
    Then I should see an appropriate empty state message
    And no pagination controls should be displayed

  Scenario: Exactly one page of analyses
    Given I have exactly 10 or fewer batch analyses
    When I visit the analyses page
    Then I should see all my analyses
    And no pagination controls should be displayed

  Scenario Outline: Page navigation states
    Given I am on page <current_page> with <total_analyses> analyses
    Then the <button> button should be <state>

    Examples:
      | current_page | total_analyses | button   | state     |
      | 1           | 25             | previous | disabled  |
      | 1           | 25             | next     | enabled   |
      | 2           | 25             | previous | enabled   |
      | 2           | 25             | next     | enabled   |
      | 3           | 25             | previous | enabled   |
      | 3           | 25             | next     | disabled  |

  Scenario: Loading states during pagination
    Given I am viewing analyses with pagination
    When I click to navigate to another page
    Then I should see loading indicators during the transition
    And the pagination controls should be temporarily disabled
    And the new page should load with the correct analyses
```

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: State Management Setup
1. [ ] Add pagination state to analyses page component
2. [ ] Implement `currentPage` and `hasMore` state tracking
3. [ ] Add `analysesPerPage` constant (default: 10)
4. [ ] Create pagination navigation handlers
5. [ ] Add loading state management for page transitions

### Phase 2: API Integration
1. [ ] Update analyses loading to use pagination parameters
2. [ ] Implement logic to detect when no more analyses are available
3. [ ] Add error handling for pagination API calls
4. [ ] Update loading skeleton count based on page size
5. [ ] Test API integration with various data scenarios

### Phase 3: UI Component Integration
1. [ ] Add `Pagination` component below analyses grid
2. [ ] Configure pagination component with proper props
3. [ ] Implement consistent styling with other paginated pages
4. [ ] Add proper spacing and layout adjustments
5. [ ] Ensure responsive behavior on mobile devices

### Phase 4: Edge Cases and Polish
1. [ ] Handle empty state when no analyses exist
2. [ ] Implement proper loading states during transitions
3. [ ] Add error recovery for failed pagination requests
4. [ ] Test edge cases (exactly 10 analyses, single analysis, etc.)
5. [ ] Verify accessibility compliance for pagination controls

## Test Plan

### Unit Tests
- [ ] Pagination state management: Current page tracking, hasMore logic
- [ ] API integration: Correct parameters passed, response handling
- [ ] Navigation handlers: Previous/next page logic
- [ ] Edge cases: Empty results, single page, API errors

### Integration Tests
- [ ] Analyses page with pagination: Full user interaction flow
- [ ] API endpoint integration: Correct data loading for each page
- [ ] Loading states: Proper UI feedback during transitions
- [ ] Responsive design: Mobile and desktop layouts

### E2E Tests
- [ ] User workflow: Create 15+ analyses and navigate through pages
- [ ] User workflow: Navigate from last page back to first page
- [ ] User workflow: Handle page refresh during pagination
- [ ] Accessibility workflow: Keyboard navigation and screen reader support

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Analyses page shows paginated results with proper controls
- [ ] Users can access all their analyses across multiple pages
- [ ] Pagination controls are intuitive and responsive
- [ ] Loading states and error handling implemented
- [ ] All tests passing with >80% coverage
