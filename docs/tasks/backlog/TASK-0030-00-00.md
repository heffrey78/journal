# TASK-0030-00-00: Standardize Modal Component Design System

**Status**: [ ] Not Started | [X] In Progress | [ ] Blocked | [ ] Complete | [ ] Abandoned
**Created**: 2025-06-11
**Updated**: 2025-06-11
**Assignee**: Claude Code
**Priority**: P2 (Medium)
**Parent Task**: N/A
**Dependencies**: None
**Estimated Effort**: L (3d)

## User Story
As a user of the Llens application,
I want all modal dialogs to have consistent visual design, behavior, and accessibility,
So that I have a predictable and professional user experience across all features.

## Context & Research

### Current State Analysis
- [X] Review existing modal implementations in components
- [X] Document current styling inconsistencies
- [X] Identify different modal systems in use
- [X] Note accessibility and UX issues

### Modal Inventory
Current modal implementations identified:
1. **BatchAnalysisDialog** - Uses Radix UI AlertDialog with automatic backdrop
2. **MoveEntriesDialog** - Uses Headless UI Dialog with manual backdrop
3. **SaveConversationDialog** - Custom implementation with manual backdrop
4. **ImportModal** - Uses Radix UI AlertDialog with automatic backdrop
5. **InConversationSearch** - Custom implementation (recently fixed for transparency)

### Technical Research
- [X] Analyzed three different modal systems currently in use
- [X] Identified inconsistent backdrop opacity (25%, 40%, 50%, 80%)
- [X] Found typography inconsistencies across modals
- [X] Noted accessibility concerns with custom implementations
- [X] Documented color scheme issues (hard-coded vs theme variables)

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] All modals use consistent backdrop styling and opacity
- [ ] Typography hierarchy standardized across all modals (titles, body text, buttons)
- [ ] Color schemes use theme variables instead of hard-coded colors
- [ ] Consistent spacing and padding patterns applied
- [ ] All modals follow same animation/transition patterns
- [ ] Button layouts and styles standardized (primary, secondary, destructive actions)
- [ ] Loading states implemented consistently
- [ ] Error handling displays consistently across modals

### Non-Functional Requirements
- [ ] All modals meet WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards
- [ ] Focus management works correctly in all modals
- [ ] Keyboard navigation (Tab, Escape, Enter) works consistently
- [ ] Screen reader compatibility verified
- [ ] Responsive design works on mobile devices
- [ ] Theme switching (light/dark mode) works correctly
- [ ] No performance regressions introduced

## Behavioral Specifications

```gherkin
Feature: Modal Design System Consistency
  As a user
  I want consistent modal experiences
  So that the interface feels polished and predictable

  Background:
    Given the application is loaded
    And I am viewing any page with modal functionality

  Scenario: Modal opening behavior
    Given I trigger any modal dialog
    When the modal opens
    Then it should have a consistent backdrop with 40% opacity
    And it should animate in smoothly
    And focus should move to the modal
    And the background should be properly obscured

  Scenario: Modal typography consistency
    Given any modal is open
    When I examine the text elements
    Then the modal title should use consistent font size and weight
    And body text should use theme-appropriate colors
    And button text should follow the design system
    And all text should be readable in both light and dark themes

  Scenario: Keyboard navigation
    Given any modal is open
    When I press the Tab key
    Then focus should move through interactive elements in logical order
    And focus should be trapped within the modal
    When I press Escape
    Then the modal should close gracefully
    And focus should return to the triggering element

  Scenario: Responsive behavior
    Given any modal is open on different screen sizes
    When I view the modal on mobile devices
    Then it should be properly sized and positioned
    And all content should remain accessible
    And scrolling should work if content overflows

  Scenario Outline: Modal action buttons
    Given a modal with <button_type> actions is open
    When I interact with the action buttons
    Then they should follow consistent styling patterns
    And destructive actions should be clearly differentiated
    And loading states should be visually consistent

    Examples:
      | button_type |
      | save        |
      | delete      |
      | cancel      |
      | import      |
      | analyze     |
```

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Analysis & Standardization Design
1. [X] Audit all existing modal implementations
2. [ ] Choose primary modal system (recommend Radix UI AlertDialog)
3. [ ] Create modal design specifications document
4. [ ] Design consistent spacing, typography, and color schemes
5. [ ] Create reusable modal components/patterns

### Phase 2: Core Modal Infrastructure
1. [ ] Create standardized Modal wrapper component
2. [ ] Implement consistent backdrop styling
3. [ ] Add standardized animation/transition system
4. [ ] Create modal header, body, footer layout components
5. [ ] Implement focus management and keyboard navigation

### Phase 3: Update Existing Modals
1. [ ] Convert BatchAnalysisDialog to new standard
2. [ ] Convert MoveEntriesDialog to new standard
3. [ ] Convert SaveConversationDialog to new standard
4. [ ] Convert ImportModal to new standard
5. [ ] Update InConversationSearch to match standards

### Phase 4: Validation & Documentation
1. [ ] Test all modals for consistency
2. [ ] Verify accessibility compliance
3. [ ] Test responsive behavior on all screen sizes
4. [ ] Update component documentation
5. [ ] Create usage guidelines for future modal development

## Test Plan

### Unit Tests
- [ ] Modal wrapper component - Rendering, props handling, event callbacks
- [ ] Modal backdrop - Click-to-close, keyboard navigation
- [ ] Focus management - Focus trap, return focus, initial focus
- [ ] Responsive behavior - Mobile layout, overflow handling

### Integration Tests
- [ ] Each modal opens and closes correctly
- [ ] Data submission and error handling
- [ ] Theme switching preserves modal state
- [ ] Modal interactions don't break page functionality

### Accessibility Tests
- [ ] Screen reader announces modal opening/closing
- [ ] Keyboard navigation works in all modals
- [ ] Color contrast meets WCAG standards
- [ ] Focus indicators are visible and clear

### Visual Regression Tests
- [ ] Modal appearance consistent across browsers
- [ ] Backdrop opacity and blur effects work correctly
- [ ] Animations play smoothly without flicker
- [ ] Typography scales properly at different zoom levels

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met and tested
- [ ] All existing modals converted to new standard
- [ ] Accessibility audit passed (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- [ ] Visual consistency verified across all modals
- [ ] Documentation updated with modal usage guidelines
- [ ] Performance testing shows no regressions
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved by team
- [ ] User testing feedback incorporated

## Technical Notes

### Recommended Implementation Approach
1. **Use Radix UI AlertDialog as base** - Provides best accessibility and customization
2. **Create Modal Design Tokens** - Define consistent spacing, colors, typography
3. **Implement Compound Components** - Modal.Header, Modal.Body, Modal.Footer patterns
4. **Theme Integration** - Use CSS variables for colors, ensure dark mode compatibility
5. **Animation System** - Use CSS transitions or Framer Motion for consistency

### Files to Modify
- `src/components/dialogs/BatchAnalysisDialog.tsx`
- `src/components/dialogs/MoveEntriesDialog.tsx`
- `src/components/dialogs/SaveConversationDialog.tsx`
- `src/components/entries/ImportModal.tsx`
- `src/components/chat/InConversationSearch.tsx`
- `src/components/ui/` (new modal components)

### Design System Integration
- Should align with existing design system in `src/components/design-system/`
- Use tokens from `src/lib/tokens.ts` and `src/lib/spacing.ts`
- Follow patterns established in other UI components
