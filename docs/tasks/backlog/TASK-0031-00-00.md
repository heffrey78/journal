## User Story
As a developer,
I want a robust and reliable LLM service,
So that I can avoid recurring issues with model availability, response format changes, and error handling.

## Context & Research

### Current State Analysis
- [ ] Review all error patterns in app/llm_service.py
- [ ] Document recent issues (e.g., ollama.list() format changes, CUDA errors, circuit breaker patterns)
- [ ] Identify fragile integration points with Ollama API
- [ ] Analyze error recovery mechanisms

### API Documentation Review
- [ ] Latest Ollama Python client version and changelog
- [ ] Document all response format variations
- [ ] Identify deprecated vs current API patterns
- [ ] Review Ollama server API documentation

### Technical Research
- [ ] Research best practices for API client resilience
- [ ] Study adapter pattern for external API integration
- [ ] Review retry strategies and circuit breaker patterns
- [ ] Investigate comprehensive testing strategies for external APIs

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] All Ollama API responses handled with proper type checking
- [ ] Graceful degradation when models are unavailable
- [ ] Comprehensive error messages with actionable recovery steps
- [ ] Response format changes don't break the service
- [ ] CUDA/GPU errors handled with automatic recovery
- [ ] Model fallback chain works reliably

### Non-Functional Requirements
- [ ] 100% test coverage for error paths
- [ ] Mock-based tests for all Ollama interactions
- [ ] Performance monitoring for API calls
- [ ] Detailed logging for debugging
- [ ] No uncaught exceptions in production

## Behavioral Specifications

Feature: Robust LLM Service Integration
  As a developer using the LLM service
  I want reliable API interactions
  So that my application remains stable

  Background:
    Given the LLM service is initialized
    And Ollama is running on the system

  Scenario: Handle varying ollama.list() response formats
    Given ollama.list() may return different formats
    When I call get_available_models()
    Then it should handle typed ListResponse objects
    And it should handle dictionary responses
    And it should log unexpected formats clearly
    And it should return a valid model list

  Scenario: Graceful model unavailability handling
    Given a configured model is not available
    When I request that model for an operation
    Then it should fall back to the next available model
    And it should log the fallback decision
    And the operation should complete successfully

  Scenario: CUDA error recovery
    Given a CUDA error occurs during operation
    When the circuit breaker is closed
    Then it should retry with exponential backoff
    And it should open the circuit breaker after threshold
    And it should provide clear error messages

  Scenario Outline: API response validation
    Given an API call to <endpoint>
    When the response format is <format>
    Then it should validate the response structure
    And handle missing fields gracefully
    And return <expected_result>

    Examples:
      | endpoint    | format           | expected_result |
      | list        | ListResponse     | model list      |
      | list        | dict             | model list      |
      | embeddings  | dict             | float array     |
      | chat        | streaming        | text chunks     |

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Testing Infrastructure
1. [ ] Create comprehensive test suite with mocks
2. [ ] Add integration tests with real Ollama
3. [ ] Implement response format fixtures
4. [ ] Add performance benchmarks

### Phase 2: Response Handling Improvements
1. [ ] Create response adapter classes
2. [ ] Implement version-agnostic parsers
3. [ ] Add response validation layer
4. [ ] Improve error messages with context

### Phase 3: Reliability Enhancements
1. [ ] Enhance circuit breaker implementation
2. [ ] Implement model availability caching
3. [ ] Add health check endpoints
4. [ ] Create fallback strategies for all operations

### Phase 4: Monitoring and Debugging
1. [ ] Add detailed logging with correlation IDs
2. [ ] Implement metrics collection
3. [ ] Create debugging utilities
4. [ ] Add performance monitoring

## Test Plan

### Unit Tests
- [ ] Response parsing for all known formats
- [ ] Error handling for each exception type
- [ ] Circuit breaker state transitions
- [ ] Model fallback logic
- [ ] Retry mechanism with backoff

## Notes
This task addresses recurring issues with the LLM service, particularly:
1. Response format changes from Ollama API updates
2. CUDA/GPU errors requiring better recovery
3. Model availability detection failures
4. Lack of comprehensive testing for error scenarios

The goal is to make the service resilient to external changes and provide clear debugging information when issues occur.
