# TASK-0033-00-00: Fix Frontend Timeout During Semantic Search

**Status**: [ ] Not Started | [ ] In Progress | [ ] Blocked | [ ] Complete | [ ] Abandoned
**Created**: 2025-01-16
**Updated**: 2025-01-16
**Assignee**: TBD
**Priority**: P1 (High)
**Parent Task**: None
**Dependencies**: None
**Estimated Effort**: M (1d)

## User Story
As a user,
I want semantic search to complete successfully without timeout errors,
So that I can reliably find entries using AI-powered search.

## Context & Research

### Current State Analysis
- [X] Review existing codebase in relevant directories
- [X] Document current functionality
- [ ] Identify integration points
- [ ] Note technical constraints

**Issue**: Frontend displays "Failed to perform semantic search. Please ensure Ollama is running on your system." even though the backend is processing the request successfully and returning results. The backend logs show:
- Semantic search takes 3-4 seconds to complete
- Backend successfully returns results with 200 OK status
- Frontend times out before receiving the response

### API Documentation Review
- [ ] Latest API version: Internal
- [X] Relevant endpoints: `/entries/search/?query=X&semantic=true`
- [ ] Breaking changes: None
- [ ] New features available: None

### Technical Research
- [ ] Similar implementations reviewed
- [ ] Best practices identified
- [ ] Performance considerations noted
- [ ] Security implications assessed

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Semantic search requests complete without frontend timeout
- [ ] Error messages accurately reflect actual backend status
- [ ] Search results are displayed correctly after completion
- [ ] Loading states are shown during search processing
- [ ] Proper error handling for actual Ollama connection failures

### Non-Functional Requirements
- [ ] Code follows project style guide
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Tests achieve >80% coverage
- [ ] No security vulnerabilities introduced

## Behavioral Specifications

Feature: Semantic Search Timeout Handling
  As a user
  I want semantic search to work reliably
  So that I can find entries without error messages

  Background:
    Given Ollama is running and accessible
    And the database has entries with embeddings

  Scenario: Successful semantic search completion
    Given I am on the entries page
    When I enter "family" in the search box
    And I enable semantic search
    Then I should see a loading indicator
    And the search should complete within 10 seconds
    And I should see relevant search results
    And no error messages should be displayed

  Scenario: Long-running semantic search
    Given I am on the entries page
    When I perform a complex semantic search
    And the search takes longer than 5 seconds
    Then I should see a progress indicator
    And the search should eventually complete
    And results should be displayed correctly

  Scenario: Actual Ollama connection failure
    Given Ollama is not running
    When I perform a semantic search
    Then I should see an accurate error message
    And the error should indicate Ollama is not accessible
    And the message should not appear prematurely

  Scenario Outline: Search timing performance
    Given I search for "<query>" with semantic search enabled
    When the search is processed
    Then the response time should be less than <max_time> seconds
    And results should be returned successfully

    Examples:
      | query   | max_time |
      | war     | 5        |
      | family  | 5        |
      | work    | 5        |
      | travel  | 5        |
```

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Investigation & Analysis
1. [ ] Analyze current frontend timeout configuration
2. [ ] Review backend response times for semantic search
3. [ ] Identify the source of timeout (frontend, proxy, or network)
4. [ ] Create feature branch: `feature/TASK-0033`

### Phase 2: Frontend Fixes
1. [ ] Increase timeout for semantic search requests
2. [ ] Implement proper loading states
3. [ ] Add better error differentiation
4. [ ] Improve user feedback during long operations

### Phase 3: Backend Optimization
1. [ ] Optimize semantic search performance
2. [ ] Add response streaming if beneficial
3. [ ] Implement proper error responses
4. [ ] Add request/response logging

### Phase 4: Validation
1. [ ] Test various search queries and timing
2. [ ] Verify error handling works correctly
3. [ ] Test with Ollama running and stopped
4. [ ] Performance testing with large datasets

## Test Plan

### Unit Tests
- [ ] Component: SearchInterface - Test cases: timeout handling, loading states
- [ ] Function: semantic search API calls - Test cases: success, timeout, error
- [ ] Edge cases covered

### Integration Tests
- [ ] Frontend to backend semantic search flow
- [ ] Timeout scenarios
- [ ] Error propagation tests

### E2E Tests
- [ ] User workflow: Search with semantic enabled
- [ ] Long-running search scenarios
- [ ] Error recovery workflows

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] No critical or high severity bugs
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] Search completes reliably without false timeouts
