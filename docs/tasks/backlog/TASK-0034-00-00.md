# TASK-0034-00-00: Optimize Semantic Search Performance

**Status**: [ ] Not Started | [ ] In Progress | [ ] Blocked | [ ] Complete | [ ] Abandoned
**Created**: 2025-01-16
**Updated**: 2025-01-16
**Assignee**: TBD
**Priority**: P2 (Medium)
**Parent Task**: None
**Dependencies**: TASK-0033-00-00
**Estimated Effort**: L (3d)

## User Story
As a user,
I want semantic search to return results quickly,
So that I can efficiently find relevant entries without long wait times.

## Context & Research

### Current State Analysis
- [X] Review existing codebase in relevant directories
- [X] Document current functionality
- [ ] Identify integration points
- [ ] Note technical constraints

**Issue**: Backend logs show semantic search takes 3-4 seconds per query, which can feel slow for users. The search involves:
1. Query expansion using LLM (adds ~200ms)
2. Embedding generation for query (~10ms)
3. Vector similarity computation across 7055+ vectors (~3-4 seconds)
4. Result ranking and formatting

### API Documentation Review
- [ ] Latest API version: Internal
- [X] Relevant endpoints: `/entries/search/?query=X&semantic=true`
- [ ] Breaking changes: None
- [ ] New features available: None

### Technical Research
- [ ] Similar implementations reviewed
- [ ] Best practices identified
- [ ] Performance considerations noted
- [ ] Security implications assessed

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Semantic search completes in under 2 seconds for typical queries
- [ ] Search quality is maintained or improved
- [ ] System handles concurrent search requests efficiently
- [ ] Memory usage remains reasonable during search operations
- [ ] Caching improves performance for repeated queries

### Non-Functional Requirements

Feature: Fast Semantic Search Performance
  As a user
  I want semantic search to be fast
  So that I can quickly find relevant entries

  Background:
    Given Ollama is running and accessible
    And the database has 7000+ entries with embeddings

  Scenario: Fast search response times
    Given I am on the entries page
    When I search for "family" with semantic search
    Then the search should complete in under 2 seconds
    And I should receive relevant results
    And the results should be ranked by relevance

  Scenario: Concurrent search performance
    Given multiple users are searching simultaneously
    When I perform a semantic search
    Then my search should complete in under 3 seconds
    And other searches should not be blocked
    And system performance should remain stable

  Scenario: Query caching effectiveness
    Given I have searched for "work" previously
    When I search for "work" again
    Then the search should complete in under 1 second
    And the results should be identical to the first search

  Scenario Outline: Performance with different dataset sizes
    Given the database contains <entry_count> entries
    When I perform a semantic search
    Then the search should complete within <time_limit> seconds

    Examples:
      | entry_count | time_limit |
      | 1000        | 1          |
      | 5000        | 1.5        |
      | 10000       | 2          |
      | 20000       | 3          |
```
