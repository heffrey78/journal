# TASK-0035-00-00: Fix Duplicate Database Initialization

**Status**: [ ] Not Started | [ ] In Progress | [ ] Blocked | [ ] Complete | [ ] Abandoned
**Created**: 2025-01-16
**Updated**: 2025-01-16
**Assignee**: TBD
**Priority**: P2 (Medium)
**Parent Task**: None
**Dependencies**: None
**Estimated Effort**: S (4h)

## User Story
As a developer,
I want database initialization to occur only once per request,
So that the application is more efficient and logs are cleaner.

## Context & Research

### Current State Analysis
- [X] Review existing codebase in relevant directories
- [X] Document current functionality
- [ ] Identify integration points
- [ ] Note technical constraints

**Issue**: Backend logs show duplicate database initialization messages for the same request:
```
[Backend] 2025-06-16 08:18:03,172 - app.utils - INFO - Initializing database...
[Backend] 2025-06-16 08:18:03,172 - app.migrate_db - INFO - Migrating database: ./journal_data/journal.db
[Backend] 2025-06-16 08:18:03,172 - app.utils - INFO - Initializing database...
[Backend] 2025-06-16 08:18:03,172 - app.migrate_db - INFO - Migrating database: ./journal_data/journal.db
```

This suggests the database initialization is being called multiple times unnecessarily, which could impact performance and create unnecessary log noise.

## Behavioral Specifications

Feature: Single Database Initialization
  As a developer
  I want clean database initialization
  So that the application is efficient and logs are readable

  Background:
    Given the application is starting up

  Scenario: Single initialization on startup
    Given the application is being started
    When the database is first accessed
    Then database initialization should occur exactly once
    And subsequent requests should not trigger re-initialization
    And all database operations should work correctly

  Scenario: Multiple concurrent requests
    Given the application is running
    When multiple API requests are made simultaneously
    Then database initialization should not be duplicated
    And all requests should be handled correctly
    And logs should not contain duplicate initialization messages

  Scenario: Database connection reuse
    Given the application has initialized the database
    When subsequent requests are made
    Then existing database connections should be reused
    And no additional initialization should occur
    And performance should be optimal

  Scenario Outline: Endpoint database access
    Given the database has been initialized once
    When I access the "<endpoint>" endpoint
    Then the database should be accessible
    And no re-initialization should occur
    And the response should be successful

    Examples:
      | endpoint           |
      | /entries           |
      | /tags              |
      | /folders           |
      | /entries/search    |
```

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Investigation
1. [ ] Identify all places where database initialization is called
2. [ ] Trace the call stack for duplicate initializations
3. [ ] Review current database connection management
4. [ ] Create feature branch: `feature/TASK-0035`

### Phase 2: Refactoring
1. [ ] Implement singleton pattern for database initialization
2. [ ] Consolidate database initialization calls
3. [ ] Improve connection pooling if needed
4. [ ] Add initialization logging controls

### Phase 3: Testing & Validation
1. [ ] Test application startup behavior
2. [ ] Verify no duplicate initialization occurs
3. [ ] Test concurrent request handling
4. [ ] Performance testing for database operations

### Phase 4: Documentation
1. [ ] Document database initialization architecture
2. [ ] Update any relevant setup documentation
3. [ ] Add code comments explaining the singleton approach

## Root Cause Analysis

### Potential Causes
- [ ] Multiple instances of StorageManager being created
- [ ] Database initialization called from multiple entry points
- [ ] Lack of initialization state tracking
- [ ] Dependency injection creating multiple instances

### Investigation Areas
- [ ] `app/utils.py` initialization functions
- [ ] `app/migrate_db.py` migration calls
- [ ] FastAPI dependency injection setup
- [ ] StorageManager instantiation patterns

### Solution Approaches
- [ ] Implement application-level singleton for database
- [ ] Use FastAPI's dependency injection for single instance
- [ ] Add initialization state checking
- [ ] Lazy initialization with locking

## Test Plan

### Unit Tests
- [ ] Component: Database initialization - Test cases: singleton behavior
- [ ] Function: Migration calls - Test cases: single execution
- [ ] Edge cases: Concurrent access, error handling

### Integration Tests
- [ ] Application startup testing
- [ ] Multiple request handling
- [ ] Database connection pooling verification

### Performance Tests
- [ ] Startup time measurement
- [ ] Database operation performance
- [ ] Memory usage verification

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Database initializes exactly once per application startup
- [ ] No duplicate log messages
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] No performance regression
- [ ] Clean application logs
