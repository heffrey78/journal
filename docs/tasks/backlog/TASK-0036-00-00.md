**Status**: [ ] Not Started | [ ] In Progress | [ ] Blocked | [ ] Complete | [ ] Abandoned
**Created**: 2025-01-16
**Updated**: 2025-01-16
**Assignee**: TBD
**Priority**: P2 (Medium)
**Parent Task**: None
**Dependencies**: None
**Estimated Effort**: L (3d)

## User Story
As a developer,
I want comprehensive unit test coverage across the codebase,
So that I can confidently make changes and catch regressions early.

## Context & Research

### Current State Analysis
- [ ] Review existing test files and coverage
- [ ] Document current test coverage percentage
- [ ] Identify untested or poorly tested modules
- [ ] Note critical paths lacking test coverage

**Issue**: The codebase lacks comprehensive unit test coverage, which increases the risk of introducing bugs and makes refactoring more dangerous. Key areas that likely need better testing include:
- Vector search functionality
- LLM service integrations
- Storage layer operations
- API endpoint handlers
- Frontend components

### API Documentation Review
- [ ] Latest API version: Internal
- [ ] Relevant endpoints: All API endpoints need test coverage
- [ ] Breaking changes: None expected
- [ ] New features available: Enhanced testing framework

### Technical Research
- [ ] Review testing best practices for FastAPI applications
- [ ] Investigate testing patterns for LLM integrations
- [ ] Research testing strategies for vector operations
- [ ] Explore frontend testing frameworks and patterns

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Overall unit test coverage reaches at least 80%
- [ ] Critical business logic has 90%+ coverage
- [ ] All API endpoints have comprehensive tests
- [ ] Vector search functionality is thoroughly tested
- [ ] LLM service operations have proper test coverage
- [ ] Storage operations are tested with mocks and real scenarios

### Non-Functional Requirements
- [ ] Tests run quickly (< 30 seconds for full suite)
- [ ] Tests are reliable and don't have flaky behavior
- [ ] Test code follows project style guide
- [ ] Test documentation is clear and comprehensive
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline includes test coverage reporting

Feature: Comprehensive Unit Test Coverage
  As a developer
  I want reliable test coverage
  So that I can maintain code quality and catch bugs early

  Background:
    Given I have a test suite for the application

  Scenario: Backend API test coverage
    Given all API endpoints exist
    When I run the backend test suite
    Then every endpoint should have unit tests
    And error cases should be covered
    And success scenarios should be validated
    And the coverage should be at least 80%

  Scenario: Vector search testing
    Given the vector search functionality exists
    When I run vector search tests
    Then embedding generation should be tested
    And similarity computation should be validated
    And error handling should be covered
    And performance edge cases should be tested

  Scenario: LLM service testing
    Given the LLM service integration exists
    When I run LLM service tests
    Then API calls should be mocked appropriately
    And error scenarios should be handled
    And timeout cases should be tested
    And response parsing should be validated

  Scenario: Storage layer testing
    Given the storage components exist
    When I run storage tests
    Then database operations should be tested
    And file system operations should be covered
    And data validation should be tested
    And transaction handling should be verified

  Scenario: Frontend component testing
    Given React components exist
    When I run frontend tests
    Then component rendering should be tested
    And user interactions should be simulated
    And state management should be validated
    And API integration should be mocked

  Scenario Outline: Module test coverage
    Given the "<module>" exists
    When I check test coverage for that module
    Then coverage should be at least <min_coverage>%
    And critical functions should have <critical_coverage>% coverage

    Examples:
      | module           | min_coverage | critical_coverage |
      | vector_search    | 85           | 95                |
      | llm_service      | 80           | 90                |
      | storage          | 80           | 90                |
      | api_endpoints    | 85           | 95                |
      | chat_service     | 80           | 90                |
```
