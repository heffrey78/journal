# C34-001: Improve LLM Service Resilience Against CUDA Errors

## Priority: High
## Status: Completed
## Estimated Effort: 2-4 hours

## User Story
**As a** journal application user
**I want** the AI chat and summarization features to work reliably
**So that** I can consistently interact with my journal entries using AI assistance

## Problem Description
The application is experiencing critical CUDA memory errors that break AI functionality. Multiple instances of "CUDA error: an illegal memory access was encountered" are occurring during LLM operations, specifically:

- Chat streaming responses fail intermittently with 500 errors
- Entry summarization operations fail randomly
- The error occurs in `ggml_backend_cuda_synchronize` function
- Ollama service appears to be experiencing memory access violations

This is a critical issue as it makes the core AI features unreliable and creates a poor user experience.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] CUDA errors are handled gracefully without returning 500 status codes
- [x] Fallback mechanisms prevent total AI feature failure
- [x] Users receive meaningful error messages when GPU issues occur
- [x] Retry logic with backoff handles transient CUDA errors
- [x] Circuit breaker prevents cascading failures during GPU instability
- [x] System logs provide clear diagnostic information for CUDA issues
- [x] Tests verify error handling and fallback behavior

## Technical Details
- **Components affected**:
  - `app/llm_service.py` (LLM service handling)
  - `app/chat_service.py` (Chat operations)
  - `app/chat_routes.py` (Error handling)
- **Current behavior**: Random CUDA memory access errors causing 500 HTTP responses
- **Expected behavior**: Graceful degradation with informative error messages when CUDA issues occur
- **Error patterns**:
  ```
  CUDA error: an illegal memory access was encountered
  current device: 0, in function ggml_backend_cuda_synchronize
  cudaStreamSynchronize(cuda_ctx->stream())
  //ml/backend/ggml/ggml/src/ggml-cuda/ggml-cuda.cu:75: CUDA error
  ```

## Implementation Plan
### Phase 1: Investigation and Diagnosis
1. Add GPU memory monitoring to identify usage patterns
2. Review Ollama configuration and model loading
3. Check for memory leaks in LLM service operations
4. Identify if issue is model-specific or system-wide

### Phase 2: Error Handling and Recovery
1. Implement graceful fallback when CUDA errors occur
2. Add retry logic with exponential backoff
3. Improve error messages returned to frontend
4. Add circuit breaker pattern for GPU operations

### Phase 3: Stability Improvements
1. Optimize memory allocation in LLM operations
2. Consider model switching or CPU fallback options
3. Add health checks for GPU/Ollama service
4. Implement proper cleanup of GPU resources

## Dependencies
- Requires access to system with CUDA-enabled GPU for testing
- May need Ollama service configuration changes

## Completion Summary
**Completed on:** 2025-06-05

### Changes Made:
- Added `CircuitBreaker` class for GPU operation protection in `app/llm_service.py`
- Implemented `_execute_with_resilience()` method with retry logic and exponential backoff
- Added CUDA error detection in `_is_cuda_error()` method
- Updated core LLM operations (`get_embedding`, `summarize_entry`, `chat_completion`) to use resilient execution
- Added new exception types: `CUDAError` and `CircuitBreakerOpen`
- Updated API routes (`app/api.py`, `app/chat_routes.py`) to handle GPU-specific errors gracefully
- Improved error messages for users with 503 status codes and retry suggestions
- Enhanced logging for better diagnosis of GPU issues

### Verification:
- Created and ran comprehensive test suite verifying all error handling scenarios
- CUDA error detection correctly identifies GPU-related failures
- Circuit breaker opens after threshold failures and recovers appropriately
- Retry logic works with exponential backoff and jitter
- API endpoints return user-friendly 503 errors instead of 500s for GPU issues
- All syntax checks passed without errors

### Technical Impact:
- Users now receive meaningful error messages instead of generic 500 errors
- Application remains functional even during GPU instability
- Circuit breaker prevents cascading failures during extended GPU issues
- Retry logic handles transient CUDA errors automatically
- Comprehensive logging aids in diagnosing GPU-related problems
