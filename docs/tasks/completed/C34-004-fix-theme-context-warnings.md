# C34-004: Fix Frontend Theme Context Fallback Warnings

## Priority: Low
## Status: Pending
## Estimated Effort: 1-2 hours

## User Story
**As a** journal application user
**I want** the theme to load smoothly without console warnings
**So that** I have a clean user experience without development noise

## Problem Description
The frontend application is generating console warnings during initial load:

```
Theme context not available yet, using fallback
```

This suggests a timing issue where components are trying to access the theme context before it's fully initialized. While this doesn't break functionality (fallback themes work), it indicates a potential race condition and creates noise in the console logs.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Theme context warnings eliminated from console logs
- [x] Theme loads consistently without fallback messages
- [x] Component rendering waits for theme context when needed
- [x] No visual flashing between fallback and actual theme
- [x] Theme switching continues to work smoothly
- [x] Performance not negatively impacted by changes
- [x] Clean console logs during application startup

## Technical Details
- **Components affected**:
  - `journal-app-next/src/components/layout/ThemeProvider.tsx`
  - `journal-app-next/src/lib/themeUtils.ts`
  - Components accessing theme context early in render cycle
- **Current behavior**: Components access theme context before it's ready, triggering fallback
- **Expected behavior**: Theme context available when components need it, no fallback warnings
- **Potential solutions**:
  - Add loading states for theme-dependent components
  - Optimize theme provider initialization
  - Use React Suspense or similar patterns

## Implementation Plan
### Phase 1: Investigation
1. Identify which components trigger the fallback warnings
2. Review theme provider initialization timing
3. Check component mount order and theme dependency chain
4. Analyze if this affects SSR/hydration

### Phase 2: Fix Timing Issues
1. Implement loading states for theme-dependent components
2. Optimize theme provider to initialize earlier
3. Add proper guards for theme context access
4. Consider using React Suspense for theme loading

### Phase 3: Testing and Optimization
1. Verify warnings are eliminated across different pages
2. Test theme switching functionality remains intact
3. Check for any visual flashing during theme load
4. Ensure no performance regression

## Dependencies
- None identified
