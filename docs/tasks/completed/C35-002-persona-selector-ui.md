# C35-002: Create Persona Selector UI Component

## Priority: High
## Status: Completed
## Estimated Effort: 3-4 hours

## User Story
**As a** journal user
**I want** to select a persona when starting a new chat
**So that** I can customize the AI's personality and behavior for my specific needs

## Problem Description
Users need an intuitive interface to select from available personas when creating a new chat session. The selector should display persona names, descriptions, and icons to help users make informed choices about which AI personality best suits their current needs.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] PersonaSelector component created with persona cards/tiles
- [x] Each persona displays name, description, and icon
- [x] Visual feedback for selected persona
- [x] Integration with new chat creation flow
- [x] Responsive design works on mobile and desktop
- [x] Accessible with keyboard navigation and screen readers
- [x] Loading and error states handled gracefully

## Technical Details
- **Components affected**:
  - `journal-app-next/src/components/chat/PersonaSelector.tsx` - New component
  - `journal-app-next/src/components/chat/ChatInterface.tsx` - Integration
  - `journal-app-next/src/app/chat/new/page.tsx` - New chat flow
  - `journal-app-next/src/api/chat.ts` - Fetch personas API
- **Current behavior**: New chats start with default system prompt
- **Expected behavior**: User selects persona before starting chat
- **API changes**: Need to call personas endpoint

## Implementation Plan
### Phase 1: Component Development
1. Create PersonaSelector component with grid layout
2. Design persona card component with icon, name, description
3. Add selection state management
4. Implement responsive design

### Phase 2: Integration
1. Update new chat page to include persona selection
2. Pass selected persona to chat creation
3. Add loading/error handling
4. Update chat interface to show current persona

## Dependencies

## Definition of Done
- [x] All acceptance criteria are met
- [x] Code follows project conventions
- [x] Tests provide adequate coverage
- [x] Documentation is updated
- [x] Code has been reviewed
- [x] No linting errors
