# C35-003: Integrate Personas with Chat Service

## Priority: High
## Status: Completed
## Estimated Effort: 2-3 hours

## User Story
**As a** journal user
**I want** my selected persona to influence the AI's responses throughout the conversation
**So that** I receive consistent, personality-appropriate responses based on my chosen AI assistant

## Problem Description
The chat service needs to be updated to use the persona's system prompt instead of a hardcoded default. When a chat session is created with a persona, all AI responses should follow that persona's guidelines and personality traits consistently throughout the conversation.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Chat service retrieves and uses persona system prompt
- [x] Existing chat sessions continue to work with default behavior
- [x] Persona information is displayed in chat interface
- [x] System prompt is properly formatted and injected into LLM requests
- [x] Chat history maintains persona context across messages
- [x] Error handling for missing or invalid personas

## Technical Details
- **Components affected**:
  - `app/chat_service.py` - Update to use persona system prompts
  - `app/chat_routes.py` - Pass persona context to service
  - `app/storage/chat.py` - Store persona_id with chat sessions
  - `journal-app-next/src/components/chat/ChatInterface.tsx` - Display persona info
- **Current behavior**: Uses hardcoded system prompt for all chats
- **Expected behavior**: Uses persona-specific system prompt based on chat session
- **Database changes**: Add persona_id column to chat_sessions table

## Implementation Plan
### Phase 1: Backend Updates
1. Update chat session creation to store persona_id
2. Modify chat service to load persona and use its system prompt
3. Handle fallback to default prompt if persona not found
4. Update chat context management

### Phase 2: Frontend Integration
1. Display current persona in chat interface header
2. Show persona icon/name in chat session
3. Update chat creation flow to pass persona selection
4. Handle persona loading states

## Dependencies
- Depends on: C35-001 (personas model and API)
- Depends on: C35-002 (persona selector UI)

## Definition of Done
- [x] All acceptance criteria are met
- [x] Code follows project conventions
- [x] Tests provide adequate coverage
- [x] Documentation is updated
- [x] Code has been reviewed
- [x] No linting errors
- [x] Feature works in both development and production modes

## Completion Summary
**Completed on:** 2025-01-07

### Changes Made:
- Updated ChatService in `app/chat_service.py` to use persona system prompts
- Added PersonaStorage integration to chat service initialization
- Modified `_prepare_conversation_history` method to load persona and use its system prompt
- Added fallback behavior when persona is not found or invalid
- Created PersonaIndicator React component to display current persona in chat interface
- Updated ChatInterface to show persona information in the header
- Added persona_id state tracking in chat session loading
- Implemented proper error handling for persona loading failures

### Verification:
- Created comprehensive test suite (`test_persona_chat_integration.py`) with all tests passing
- Verified persona system prompts are used instead of default chat config
- Confirmed fallback to default system prompt when persona is unavailable
- Tested chat interface displays persona information correctly
- Verified backward compatibility with existing chat sessions without personas
- Frontend builds successfully without compilation errors

### Technical Impact:
- Chat service now dynamically loads persona system prompts per session
- Clean separation between persona logic and existing chat functionality
- Graceful degradation when personas are unavailable
- Visual feedback in UI shows which persona is active for each conversation
- Maintains all existing chat features while adding persona functionality
