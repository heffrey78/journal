# C35-004: Create Persona Management Interface

## Priority: Medium
## Status: Completed
## Estimated Effort: 4-5 hours

## User Story
**As a** journal user
**I want** to create, edit, and delete custom personas
**So that** I can customize AI personalities to match my specific needs and preferences

## Problem Description
While default personas provide a good starting point, users should be able to create their own custom personas with personalized system prompts, names, and descriptions. This allows for highly customized AI interactions tailored to specific use cases or personal preferences.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Persona management page accessible from settings
- [x] List view of all personas (default and custom)
- [x] Create new persona form with name, description, system prompt fields
- [x] Edit existing custom personas (default personas read-only)
- [x] Delete custom personas with confirmation
- [x] Persona validation (required fields, prompt length limits)
- [x] Preview functionality to test persona before saving
- [x] Import/export persona functionality

## Technical Details
- **Components affected**:
  - `journal-app-next/src/app/settings/personas/page.tsx` - New page
  - `journal-app-next/src/components/settings/PersonaManager.tsx` - Management component
  - `journal-app-next/src/components/dialogs/PersonaEditor.tsx` - Edit dialog
  - `journal-app-next/src/api/chat.ts` - Persona CRUD API calls
- **Current behavior**: No persona management interface exists
- **Expected behavior**: Full CRUD interface for personas in settings
- **API changes**: Need full CRUD endpoints for personas

## Implementation Plan
### Phase 1: Basic Management UI
1. Create personas settings page
2. Add persona list component with cards
3. Implement create/edit persona dialog
4. Add form validation and error handling

### Phase 2: Advanced Features
1. Add persona preview/test functionality
2. Implement import/export for sharing personas
3. Add persona usage statistics
4. Create persona templates/presets

## Dependencies
- Depends on: C35-001 (personas model and API)

## Definition of Done
- [x] All acceptance criteria are met
- [x] Code follows project conventions
- [x] Tests provide adequate coverage
- [x] Documentation is updated
- [x] Code has been reviewed
- [x] No linting errors
- [x] Feature works in both development and production modes
