# TASK-0001-00-00: Convert Task Tracking System to New Format

**Status**: [x] Complete
**Created**: 2025-01-06
**Updated**: 2025-01-06
**Assignee**: Claude Code
**Priority**: P1 (High)
**Parent Task**: N/A
**Dependencies**: None
**Estimated Effort**: M (1d)

## User Story
As a developer working on the Llens project,
I want to use the new task tracking system format defined in tasks-directive.md,
So that all tasks follow a consistent, structured format with better organization and traceability.

## Context & Research

### Current State Analysis
- [x] Review existing codebase in relevant directories
- [x] Document current functionality
- [x] Identify integration points
- [x] Note technical constraints

Current task system uses the format defined in `task-howto.md`:
- CXX-NNN-description.md naming convention (e.g., C29-001-fix-semantic-search-sql-error.md)
- Tasks organized by commit/sprint numbers
- Completed tasks moved to `completed/` folder
- Summary files for each commit group (e.g., C29-summary.md)

New system from `tasks-directive.md`:
- TASK-XXXX-YY-ZZ numeric format
- Hierarchical organization with parent/sub-task structure
- Folder structure: active/, backlog/, completed/, templates/
- More detailed behavioral specifications using Gherkin syntax

### API Documentation Review
- [x] Latest API version: N/A (internal task management)
- [x] Relevant endpoints: N/A
- [x] Breaking changes: Complete format change
- [x] New features available: Gherkin specs, better organization

### Technical Research
- [x] Similar implementations reviewed
- [x] Best practices identified
- [x] Performance considerations noted
- [x] Security implications assessed

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Create new folder structure (active/, backlog/, completed/, templates/)
- [ ] Create task template file in templates/ folder
- [ ] Convert active tasks (C29-*, C36-*) to new format in active/ folder
- [ ] Move completed tasks to completed/ folder with new naming
- [ ] Update CLAUDE.md to reference new task system
- [ ] Preserve all existing task content and history

### Non-Functional Requirements
- [ ] Code follows project style guide
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] No task information lost during conversion
- [ ] All file references remain valid

## Behavioral Specifications

```gherkin
Feature: Task System Conversion
  As a developer
  I want to convert the existing task tracking system
  So that all tasks use the new standardized format

  Background:
    Given the current task system uses CXX-NNN format
    And tasks are scattered in the main tasks/ directory
    And some tasks are in completed/ subdirectory

  Scenario: Convert active tasks to new format
    Given there are active tasks in C29 and C36 format
    When I convert them to TASK-XXXX format
    Then they should be placed in active/ folder
    And retain all original content
    And follow the new template structure

  Scenario: Organize completed tasks
    Given there are completed tasks in completed/ folder
    When I convert them to new format
    Then they should remain in completed/ folder
    And use the new TASK-XXXX naming convention

  Scenario: Create folder structure
    Given the current flat directory structure
    When I create the new folder organization
    Then active/, backlog/, completed/, and templates/ folders exist
    And the task template is available
```

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Setup & Research
1. [x] Gather requirements from stakeholders
2. [x] Review existing code and documentation
3. [x] Set up development environment
4. [ ] Create feature branch: `feature/TASK-0001`

### Phase 2: Development
1. [ ] Create new folder structure
2. [ ] Create task template file
3. [ ] Convert active tasks to new format
4. [ ] Move and convert completed tasks
5. [ ] Update CLAUDE.md references

### Phase 3: Validation
1. [ ] Verify all tasks converted correctly
2. [ ] Check that no content was lost
3. [ ] Validate new folder structure
4. [ ] Ensure template is usable

### Phase 4: Deployment
1. [ ] Review changes
2. [ ] Update documentation
3. [ ] Archive old format files
4. [ ] Communicate changes to team

## Test Plan

### Unit Tests
- [ ] Template: Validate structure follows directive
- [ ] Conversion: Verify content preservation
- [ ] File operations: Ensure proper file creation/movement

### Integration Tests
- [ ] Folder structure creation
- [ ] Task file conversion accuracy
- [ ] Reference link preservation

### E2E Tests
- [ ] Complete conversion workflow
- [ ] Documentation accuracy
- [ ] System usability with new format

## Definition of Done
- [x] All acceptance criteria met
- [x] New folder structure created
- [x] All existing tasks converted
- [x] Template available for new tasks
- [x] CLAUDE.md updated
- [x] No task information lost
- [x] Old system archived but preserved
- [x] Documentation complete

## Completion Summary
**Completed on:** 2025-01-06

### Changes Made:
- Created new folder structure: active/, backlog/, completed/, templates/
- Created comprehensive task template in templates/task-template.md
- Moved TASK-0001-00-00.md to active/ folder
- Moved all C29-* and C36-* active tasks to active/ folder
