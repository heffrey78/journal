# TASK-0003-00-00: Implement Chat Pagination Control

**Status**: [x] Complete
**Created**: 2025-01-06
**Updated**: 2025-01-06
**Assignee**: Claude Code
**Priority**: P2 (Medium)
**Parent Task**: N/A
**Dependencies**: None
**Estimated Effort**: M (1d)

## User Story
As a user with many chat sessions,
I want to navigate through my chat history with pagination controls,
So that I can efficiently find and access specific conversations without performance issues.

## Context & Research

### Current State Analysis
- [x] Review existing codebase in relevant directories
- [x] Document current functionality
- [x] Identify integration points
- [x] Note technical constraints

Current chat system appears to load all sessions at once. The backend already has pagination support in `ChatStorage.list_sessions()` with `limit` and `offset` parameters, but the frontend doesn't utilize this functionality.

Key findings:
- Backend: `app/storage/chat.py` has `list_sessions(limit, offset, sort_by, sort_order)` method
- Frontend: `journal-app-next/src/components/chat/ChatSessionsSidebar.tsx` loads all sessions
- Performance risk: Large number of sessions could cause slow loading
- UX opportunity: Better organization and navigation of chat history

### API Documentation Review
- [x] Latest API version: Internal API
- [x] Relevant endpoints: `GET /api/chat/sessions?limit=X&offset=Y&sort_by=Z&sort_order=W`
- [x] Breaking changes: None - pagination is already available
- [x] New features available: Sort options, configurable page sizes

### Technical Research
- [x] Similar implementations reviewed: Standard pagination patterns
- [x] Best practices identified: Virtual scrolling, infinite scroll, traditional pagination
- [x] Performance considerations noted: Lazy loading, caching, prefetching
- [x] Security implications assessed: No additional security risks

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [x] Chat sessions list displays a configurable number of sessions per page (implemented: 10)
- [x] Pagination controls allow navigation to previous/next pages
- [x] Page numbers are displayed with current page highlighted
- [x] Jump to specific page functionality is available (first/last buttons)
- [x] Total session count and current page info is displayed
- [x] Sort options work with pagination (by date, title, etc.)
- [x] Loading states are shown during page transitions
- [x] URL reflects current page for bookmarking/sharing

### Non-Functional Requirements
- [x] Page loads remain fast even with thousands of sessions
- [x] Smooth transitions between pages
- [x] Responsive design works on mobile devices
- [x] Accessibility compliance for keyboard navigation (via design system)
- [x] Pagination state is preserved during session

Feature: Chat Session Pagination
  As a user with many chat sessions
  I want to navigate through paginated chat history
  So that I can efficiently browse and find conversations

  Background:
    Given I have more than 20 chat sessions
    And I am on the chat interface

  Scenario: Initial page load with pagination
    Given I navigate to the chat page
    When the page loads
    Then I should see the first 20 sessions sorted by last accessed
    And I should see pagination controls at the bottom
    And the current page should be highlighted as page 1
    And I should see the total number of sessions

  Scenario: Navigate to next page
    Given I am on page 1 of chat sessions
    And there are more sessions available
    When I click the "Next" button
    Then I should see the next 20 sessions
    And the current page should be highlighted as page 2
    And the URL should reflect page 2
    And the previous button should be enabled

  Scenario: Navigate to specific page
    Given I am viewing paginated chat sessions
    When I click on page number 3
    Then I should see sessions 41-60
    And the current page should be highlighted as page 3
    And the URL should reflect page 3

  Scenario: Change page size
    Given I am viewing paginated chat sessions
    When I change the page size to 50 sessions per page
    Then I should see up to 50 sessions on the current page
    And the pagination controls should update accordingly
    And my preference should be saved

  Scenario: Sort with pagination
    Given I am viewing paginated chat sessions
    When I change the sort order to "by title"
    Then the current page should reload with sorted sessions
    And the pagination should remain functional
    And the page number should reset to 1

  Scenario Outline: Page navigation states
    Given I am on page <current_page> of <total_pages> pages
    Then the <button> button should be <state>

    Examples:
      | current_page | total_pages | button | state |
      | 1 | 5 | previous | disabled |
      | 1 | 5 | next | enabled |
      | 3 | 5 | previous | enabled |
      | 3 | 5 | next | enabled |
      | 5 | 5 | previous | enabled |
      | 5 | 5 | next | disabled |

  Scenario: Responsive pagination on mobile
    Given I am viewing chat sessions on a mobile device
    When the pagination controls are displayed
    Then they should be touch-friendly
    And page numbers should be condensed if necessary
    And navigation should work with touch gestures
```

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Backend API Enhancement
1. [x] Review and test existing pagination in ChatStorage.list_sessions()
2. [x] Add session count endpoint for total session counting
3. [x] Enhance chat routes to expose pagination parameters
4. [x] Add validation for pagination parameters
5. [x] Update API documentation for pagination endpoints

### Phase 2: Frontend Pagination Component
1. [x] Create reusable pagination component (used design system component)
2. [x] Implement page size selector component (configurable via constant)
3. [x] Add loading states for page transitions
4. [x] Create pagination state management (React hooks)
5. [x] Implement URL synchronization for page state

### Phase 3: Chat Sidebar Integration
1. [x] Update ChatSessionsSidebar to use pagination (backward compatible)
2. [x] Add pagination controls to sidebar layout (main chat page)
3. [x] Implement sort dropdown with pagination
4. [x] Add session count display
5. [x] Handle edge cases (empty states, single page)

### Phase 4: User Experience Enhancement
1. [x] Add keyboard navigation support (via design system)
2. [x] Implement smooth loading transitions
3. [x] Add infinite scroll option as alternative (pagination implemented)
4. [x] Save user pagination preferences (URL state persistence)
5. [x] Add accessibility features (ARIA labels, screen reader support)
