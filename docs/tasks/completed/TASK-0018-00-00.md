# TASK-0018-00-00: Fix Enhanced Retrieval Test Errors

**Status**: [x] Completed
**Created**: 2025-01-09
**Updated**: 2025-01-10
**Assignee**: Claude
**Priority**: P3 (Low)
**Parent Task**: N/A
**Dependencies**: None
**Estimated Effort**: M (1d)

## User Story
As a developer,
I want the enhanced retrieval tests to pass,
So that the enhanced retrieval functionality is properly validated.

## Context & Research

### Current State Analysis
- [x] Enhanced retrieval tests have multiple errors
- [x] Issues appear to be in test_enhanced_retrieval.py
- [x] Errors suggest problems with enhanced retrieval implementation
- [x] Not related to current model configuration task
- [x] **UPDATE**: All enhanced retrieval tests are now passing (9/9 tests pass)

### API Documentation Review
- [x] Latest API version: Internal enhanced retrieval API
- [x] Relevant endpoints: Enhanced retrieval functionality
- [x] Breaking changes: Unknown - investigation needed
- [x] New features available: Enhanced retrieval capabilities

### Technical Research
- [x] Enhanced retrieval is a separate feature from current work
- [x] Errors suggest implementation or test infrastructure issues
- [x] May require investigation of enhanced retrieval logic
- [x] Could be related to dependency issues or API changes

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [x] All enhanced retrieval tests pass
- [x] Enhanced retrieval functionality works correctly
- [x] Test infrastructure properly supports enhanced retrieval
- [x] No regression in existing retrieval functionality

### Non-Functional Requirements
- [x] Tests run within reasonable time
- [x] Enhanced retrieval performance is acceptable
- [x] Clear error messages for debugging
- [x] Proper test isolation

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Investigation
1. [x] Analyze specific test failures in enhanced retrieval
2. [x] Review enhanced retrieval implementation
3. [x] Identify root cause of test errors
4. [x] Determine if issue is in code or tests

### Phase 2: Fix Implementation
1. [x] Fix identified issues in enhanced retrieval logic (Already fixed)
2. [x] Update tests if needed (No updates needed)
3. [x] Ensure proper integration with rest of system
4. [x] Validate functionality works end-to-end

### Phase 3: Validation
1. [x] Run all enhanced retrieval tests
2. [x] Test integration with main application
3. [x] Performance testing
4. [x] Regression testing

## Definition of Done
- [x] All enhanced retrieval tests pass
- [x] Enhanced retrieval functionality works correctly
- [x] No regression in existing features
- [x] Tests provide good coverage of functionality

## Resolution Summary
This task was created to fix enhanced retrieval test errors. Upon investigation on 2025-01-10, all enhanced retrieval tests in `tests/test_enhanced_retrieval.py` are passing (9/9 tests). The errors mentioned in the task description appear to have been resolved in a previous commit. No additional fixes were required.
