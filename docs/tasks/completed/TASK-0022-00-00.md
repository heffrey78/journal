# TASK-0022-00-00: Fix Chat Config Schema Migration Conflicts

## Status
- **Status**: Completed
- **Assigned**: Claude
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Created**: 2025-06-09
- **Updated**: 2025-01-10

## Description
Chat configuration tests are failing due to schema migration conflicts between old and new column names, specifically `max_context_tokens` vs `max_tokens`.

## Error Details
```
sqlite3.IntegrityError: NOT NULL constraint failed: chat_config.max_context_tokens
```

**Affected Tests:**
- `tests/test_chat_storage.py::TestChatStorage::test_chat_config`

**Error Location:**
- `app/storage/chat.py:941` - `cursor.execute(insert_query, tuple(insert_values))`

## Root Cause
1. Chat config table has legacy `max_context_tokens` column marked as NOT NULL
2. Migration code tries to insert without providing value for legacy column
3. Schema migration logic doesn't properly handle column renames
4. Test database setup creates table with both old and new columns

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Fix chat config schema migration to handle column renames properly
- [ ] Ensure legacy `max_context_tokens` column gets proper default values
- [ ] Update test database setup to match production schema evolution
- [ ] Chat config tests pass without integrity constraint violations
- [ ] Both old and new schemas can be migrated successfully

## Implementation Steps
1. **Fix Migration Logic** (`app/storage/chat.py`)
   - Handle `max_context_tokens` to `max_tokens` migration properly
   - Provide default values for legacy NOT NULL columns
   - Ensure backward compatibility during migration

2. **Update Insert Logic**
   - Include legacy columns in INSERT statements when they exist
   - Use proper default values for renamed/deprecated columns
   - Handle mixed schema scenarios gracefully

3. **Test Database Setup**
   - Ensure test database schema matches expected migration states
   - Verify migration logic works with both fresh and existing databases

## Technical Details
The issue occurs because:
- Test database has `max_context_tokens` as NOT NULL
- Code tries to INSERT without providing value for this column
- Migration code doesn't handle the column rename properly

## Related Issues
- Part of database schema migration improvements
- Related to chat functionality testing
- Affects chat configuration management

## Resolution Summary
This issue has been resolved. The chat config test is now passing. The schema migration conflicts between `max_context_tokens` and `max_tokens` have been fixed in a previous commit.
