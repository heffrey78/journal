# C29-002: Advanced Search Filtering

## Priority: Medium
## Status: Pending
## Estimated Effort: 3-4 hours

## User Story
**As a** journal user
**I want** advanced filtering options for my searches
**So that** I can narrow down results by date range, tags, content type, and other criteria

## Problem Description
Current search functionality is basic and doesn't provide filtering capabilities, making it difficult to find specific entries in large journals.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Add date range filtering (from/to dates)
- [x] Add tag-based filtering (include/exclude specific tags)
- [x] Add content length filtering (short/medium/long entries)
- [x] Add entry type filtering if multiple types exist
- [ ] Combine filters with AND/OR logic
- [x] Persist filter preferences in user session
- [x] Add filter reset functionality

## Technical Details
- **Components**: Search UI, API endpoints, database queries
- **New endpoints**: Enhanced search API with filter parameters
- **UI changes**: Filter panel in search interface
- **Database**: Optimized queries for filtered searches

## Definition of Done
- Search interface includes filter options
- Filters can be combined and applied effectively
- Search performance remains acceptable with filters
- Filter state is preserved during session
