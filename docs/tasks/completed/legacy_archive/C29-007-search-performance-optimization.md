# C29-007: Search Performance Optimization

## Priority: High
## Status: Pending
## Estimated Effort: 2-3 hours

## User Story
**As a** journal user with a large collection of entries
**I want** fast and responsive search functionality
**So that** I can find information quickly without waiting for slow queries

## Problem Description
As the journal grows in size, search performance may degrade. Current semantic search limitations (10 results) suggest performance constraints.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Analyze current search performance bottlenecks
- [ ] Optimize database indexes for search queries
- [ ] Implement search result caching where appropriate
- [ ] Add search query optimization (stemming, synonyms)
- [ ] Ensure semantic search scales with large datasets
- [ ] Add search performance monitoring and logging
- [ ] Implement progressive search (show results as they come)
- [ ] Optimize vector search index efficiency

## Technical Details
- **Database**: Index optimization for full-text and vector search
- **Caching**: Redis or in-memory caching for frequent queries
- **Algorithms**: Search optimization techniques
- **Monitoring**: Performance metrics and logging

## Definition of Done
- Search queries execute in under 500ms for typical datasets
- Large journals (1000+ entries) maintain fast search performance
- Performance monitoring provides insights for optimization
- Search scales gracefully with data growth
