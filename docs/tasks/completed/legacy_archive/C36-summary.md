# Commit 36: Improved Persona UX - Task Summary

## Overview
This commit focuses on improving the user experience for persona selection by moving it from a separate page during chat creation to an integrated dropdown in the chat interface. This allows users to switch personas seamlessly during conversations and makes persona selection more discoverable and accessible.

  - Bug fix for references that flash on screen but disappear on first display, work properly on subsequent displays

### Low Priority
- [x] [C36-004: Remove Border Around Import Button](./C36-004-remove-import-button-border.md) - **Status: Pending** (0.5-1 hours)

  - Critical fix for web search tool not being recognized by LLM, causing hallucination

## Total Estimated Effort
- High Priority: 1 hour (completed)
- Medium Priority: 8-12 hours
- Low Priority: 0.5-1 hours
- **Total: 9.5-14 hours**

## Implementation Order
1. C36-001 (complete UX improvement for persona selection)

## Dependencies
- C36-001 depends on C35 persona system completion
- No blocking dependencies for other features

## Success Metrics
- Users can switch personas without creating new chat sessions
- Persona selection is more discoverable and accessible
- Chat creation flow is simplified and faster
- Persona changes work seamlessly mid-conversation
- No regression in existing persona functionality

## Technical Architecture

### Backend Changes
- **API Enhancement**: Add endpoint for updating chat session persona
- **Chat Service**: Dynamic persona application to new messages
- **Session Management**: Track persona changes per session

### Frontend Changes
- **PersonaDropdown**: New compact component for chat interface
- **ChatInterface**: Integration of persona controls with existing model selector
- **Simplified Flow**: Remove separate persona selection page requirement

## User Journey (After Implementation)
1. User starts new chat (automatically uses default persona)
2. User can immediately change persona via dropdown in chat interface
3. Persona change applies to subsequent messages
4. User can switch personas multiple times during conversation
5. Persona state is preserved in chat session

## Risk Mitigation
- Ensure backward compatibility with existing chat sessions
- Preserve default persona behavior for users who don't actively select
- Maintain persona consistency within individual messages
- Test edge cases like rapid persona switching
