## Behavioral Specifications

```gherkin
Feature: [Feature name]
  As a [user type]
  I want [feature]
  So that [benefit]

  Background:
    Given [initial context]
    And [additional context]

  Scenario: [Happy path scenario]
    Given [initial state]
    When [action taken]
    Then [expected outcome]
    And [additional outcome]

  Scenario: [Error scenario]
    Given [initial state]
    When [error condition]
    Then [error handling]
    And [recovery action]

  Scenario Outline: [Parameterized scenario]
    Given [state with <parameter>]
    When [action with <input>]
    Then [outcome should be <output>]

    Examples:
      | parameter | input | output |
      | value1    | data1 | result1 |
      | value2    | data2 | result2 |
```
